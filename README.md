[comment]: <> ([![Build Status]&#40;https://travis-ci.org/pyblish/pyblish-starter.svg?branch=master&#41;]&#40;https://travis-ci.org/pyblish/pyblish-starter&#41; [![Coverage Status]&#40;https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pyblish/pyblish-starter/badge.svg?branch=master&#41;]&#40;https://coveralls.io/github/pyblish/pyblish-starter?branch=master&#41; [![PyPI version]&#40;https://badge.fury.io/py/pyblish-starter.svg&#41;]&#40;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblish-starter&#41;)

A basic asset creation pipeline for Blender. Based off of the original [pyblish-starter](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-starter) by Marcus Ottosson.

This project uses [pyblish-blender](https://github.com/jasperges/pyblish-blender) instead of pyblish-maya.
